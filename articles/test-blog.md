It’s the tailwind of 2019 – the shadow of the pandemic has yet to hit the world, but its impact is slowly starting to be felt.

I’m sitting alone at the condo lounge, where I often find myself doing work, except this time, things are different. A typical work day for me was simple: study for my Software Development degree (I should say attempt to ‘study’) for a few hours, watch some YouTube videos, hit the gym and then head off to my bartending gig until 2-3 am, wake up around 11 pm the next day and do it all over again; life was simple.

**Once the pandemic hit – everything changed.**

I lost my job. School went online. My gym closed.

Sitting there, alone, in the quietness of the lounge, I realized that I no longer had to rush out the door and run off to do the next thing instead, I was faced with the reality in front of me – I had time to do things that previously I would postpone, excusing myself as _‘too busy’_ to pursue it.

I was excited about this new chapter; elated to know that I could pour my heart & soul into a new endeavour; run off into a new direction that previously felt unattainable, scary and unknown. In all honesty, I remember feeling _happy_ at that moment because I felt like I could conquer the world, that everything was within my reach, and nothing was an obstacle.

**So, I got to work.**

I started a business with two amazing co-founders – something that I’ve been dreaming about for years building up to that moment. In May of 2020, we officially incorporated [Snakebyte Studios](https://www.snakebyte.ca/) – a creative experience agency that was going to be the vehicle that would drive me towards success. Myself behind the wheel, and my two partners beside me; _our agency was going to change the advertising landscape in Toronto_ and, with that, _our lives._

I’m going to skip most of the story from this point on because it involves a lot of mundane, day-to-day entrepreneurial moments: learning to put out fires, absorbing new information on a day-to-day basis on how to build a business, managing employees & client expectations, constant failures and micro successes. I’ll tell you one thing tho – _life was fun_. I was completely tunnel visioned on success, nothing bothered me, and any adversity was met with unbreakable optimism – **I felt unstoppable.**

Fast forward to the beginning of 2022. The business collapsed, my motivation to pursue it extinguished, and my dreams, along with my identity, shattered before my eyes. I felt exhausted, drained, emotionally fatigued and mentally unable to cope with my life – in other words, I got **burnt out.**

**Burnout** is a real thing – despite what our parents, or society, might say. It’s not as simple as _“get over it”_ or _“stop feeling sorry for yourself; just get back to work, and it will all go away.”_

When you’re burnt out, you’re in a state that comes from long-term, unresolved _stress_ that can impact your entire life. Nobody _wants to burn out_, yet year over year, there has been an increase in the number of people experiencing burnout. [Google searches of ‘signs of burnout’ increased by over 200%](https://www.hrmagazine.co.uk/content/news/google-searches-of-signs-of-burnout-increase-by-over-200/).

Burnout occurs over 5 stages:

1.  **HONEYMOON PHASE**

You’ve undertaken a new task; life feels novel & exciting. You’re energized, creative, and have plenty of satisfaction with your daily routine.

2.  **ONSET OF STRESS**

Suddenly, some days are more difficult than others. You begin to feel pangs of anxiety, avoidance of decision making, change in appetite, irritability & poor sleep.

3.  **CHRONIC STRESS**

You’ve been grinding the gears for too long, and your motivation has been shot, along with your desire to be a productive human being. Constant exhaustion, decreased sexual desire, aggression, and procrastination engulf you.

4.  **BURNOUT**

Congratulations, you’ve reached burnout! Every day becomes difficult to cope with. You feel like you’ve hit your limit, and even getting up in the morning feels like an enormous task.

5.  **HABITUAL BURNOUT**

If left untreated, your life becomes a constant state of chronic mental fatigue, depression, sadness and physical issues. You have become one with the burnout (and not in a good way.)

Naturally, we all want to stay within the HONEYMOON PHASE - forever - but without proper coping mechanisms, you will begin to see yourself descend the burnout ladder until you’ve hit bottom – and that’s not a place that’s fun to be at.

**AFTERSHOCK**
This by no means is a sob story – in fact, one that I hope proves to be inspirational.

I've since moved on from my doom-and-gloom mindset and have embarked on a new adventure. I write for amazing clients, I develop websites (like my personal one!) and am finishing up my last few courses at school.

This coming year, I will continue to hone my craft, while actively engaging in interesting AI trends/technologies that I can learn to leverage to augment my productivity/output as a solopreneur.

I'm beyond thrilled to wake up each day with a purpose – and have long since realized that life is an emotional rollercoaster filled with scary, exhilarating peaks, and long, depressing lows – that's the beauty of life.
