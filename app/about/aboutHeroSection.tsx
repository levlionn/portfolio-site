          My Mentality: Never stop working on yourself.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-500">
          I juggle a few hobbies: writing, coding, guitar, martial arts and
          gaming. I love diving into new challenges without knowing the path
          forward. In my 26 years of life, my biggest takaway is: comfort kills,
          life's too short, and live with intention. Yet, give yourself space to
          breathe and enjoy the moment â€“ enjoy life.
