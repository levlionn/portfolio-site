          I'm a passionate and adventurous person with a variety of interests,
          including writing, coding, playing guitar, practicing martial arts,
          and gaming. I thrive on taking on new challenges, even when the path
          forward is uncertain.

          Over the course of my 26 years, I've learned that comfort can be a
          trap, and life is too short to not live with intention. That said, I
          also believe in giving myself space to breathe and enjoy the moment,
          and I try to make the most of every opportunity to savour the joys of
          life.
