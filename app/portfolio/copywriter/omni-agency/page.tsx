            As a freelance copywriter and guerrilla marketing expert for a
            digital marketing agency, I worked with multiple Web3/NFT brands to
            develop content marketing and social media strategies that drove
            growth and engagement.

              educational content that attracted and retained audiences for the
              Web3/NFT brands I worked with. However, a major challenge was
              educating audiences on this relatively new field, which required a
              three-pronged approach: converting uninitiated users into brand
              advocates, retaining their engagement across social channels, and
              driving user acquisition for the accounts I managed.
