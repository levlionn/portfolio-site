        <p>Let's find out. </p>

          The reality is you might have a robot making you breakfast a lot
          sooner than you think.

          Two days ago open AI release, GPT-4 a next-step-towards-AGI upgrade to
          the current GPT-3 model.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          This move represents a significant step towards broadly useful and
          quote unquote, safely deployed AI systems for all{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're thinking that AI is still a few years away from replacing
          humans, think again, here is what open AI's researchers have to say
          about the economic impact of GPT-4.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the technical report, it reads impact of G P T four on the economy
          and workforce should be a crucial consideration for policy makers and
          other It goes on to say that the current.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Could result <span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:01:00]</span> in
          workforce displacement, especially
        </p>
        <p>
          for jobs that historically required years of experience and education,
          like legal services.
        </p>
        <p>It's not all bad, however, they go on to mention the </p>
        <p>
          model's potential in augmenting human workers to help upskill the
          workforce through the assistance provided by GPT-4.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>In fact, GPT-4 is already being used in </p>
        <p>Programming assistance, </p>
        <p>creative writing, </p>
        <p>and even medical diagnosis. </p>
        <p>
          However, the role of GPT-4 and its impact on society raises concerns
          and debate of its long term implications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even the paper notes that despite GPT-4's capabilities, it maintains a
          tendency to make up facts to double down on incorrect information and
          to perform tasks incorrectly. The scary thing is it often exhibits
          these tendencies in ways that are more convincing and believable than
          earlier GPT models.
        </p>
        <p>
          So it can lie convincingly and you won't even know the difference.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The reality is GPT-4 represents a milestone in human evolution. By
          harnessing its power, we can{" "}
          <span style={{ color: "#808080" }}>[00:02:00]</span> unlock new
          solutions to pressing issues and elevate the quality of life for all
          of us in society.
        </p>
        <p>The downside is that we're not the captain of this ship. </p>
        <p>In fact, in the same paper, buried on page 53, under </p>
        <p>potential for risky emergent behavior. They say this,</p>
        <p>
          novel capabilities often emerge in more powerful models. Some that are
          particularly concerning are the ability to create and act on long-term
          plans to accrue power and resources in quotations, power seeking, and
          to exhibit behavior that is increasingly agentic..
        </p>
        <p>
          Agentic, in this case, they elaborate further means: (1) to accomplish
          goals which may not have been concretely specified and which have not
          appeared in training ,( 2) focus on achieving specific quantifiable
          objectives, and (3) do long-term planning.
        </p>
        <p>Well, here's a plot twist. </p>
        <p>Some evidence already exists of such emergent behavior in models.</p>

          in, its iRobot literally coming for us.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          So yes, even though GPT-4 is factually more accurate and smarter than
          previous models,{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          knowing that it has the potential to unlock itself and roam free, and
          that we are not a hundred percent in control of its behavior, frankly,
          it's a terrifying thought..
        </p>
        <p>
          So I'll leave you with this. Consider rewatching iRobot or a
          Terminator and ask yourself, is this what we're heading towards? What
          are your thoughts about ChatGPT, GPT-4, AI in general? Is it gonna be
          the best thing for all of us, or is it gonna be something where we're
          walking off a cliff and we have no idea that it's even there. Leave
          your comments below. Share your thoughts. Let's have a conversation.
          I'm really curious to hear what you have to say. It's a wild time to
          live in. That's crazy. All right. Peace.

              Video Creation Process
            </h3>
            <p>
              Creating this project was a blast! I got to experiment with new
              tools, pick my brain for creativity and release a final product I
              am proud of!
            </p>
            <p>Here are the steps I took to creating this video:</p>
            <ul>
              <li className="my-2">
                1: Researched my topic – came across GPT-4, and the Research
                Paper associated with it.
              </li>
              <li className="my-2">
                2: Began reading it, instantly got intrigued by it and decided
                this will make the perfect news topic.
              </li>
              <li className="my-2">
                3: Wrote out my script using an engaging storytelling structure
                as my outline (Opening, Introduction, Impact, Conflict, Theme &
                Emotional Resonance, and Conclusion)
              </li>
              <li className="my-2">
                4: Screenshotted my images from the report
              </li>
              <li className="my-2">
                5: Set up my shooting environment (Lighting, Background, Camera)
              </li>
              <li className="my-2">
                5: Set up my shooting environment (Lighting, Background, Camera)
              </li>
              <li>7: Edited my video</li>
              <p>
                I should mention that all my footage, music and images are
                commercially available and I have legal rights to use them. I
                used a websited call EnvatoElements that has thousands of stock
                images/videos/music that I can use – I am a paying member of it.
              </p>
              <p>
                All the videos and images correspond with the script and what
                I'm saying. I wanted to add a variety of factual images for
                credibility, but sprinkle in humoerous GIFs, as well as myself
                (to get that talking-head video structure).
              </p>
              <li className="my-2">8: Got feedback from friends/family</li>
              <li className="my-2">9: Polished my video</li>
              <li className="my-2">10: Published to YouTube</li>
              <p>
                I've always wanted to release a video for YouTube, so this
                assignment felt like the perfect opportunity for me to get it
                done! It also made it easier for me to embed the video on the
                website, since I don't have to host a large file myself.{" "}

              Difficulties & Learnings
            </h3>
            <p className="my-2">
              Learning how to record audio (and how to polish it/remaster it),
              as well as editing (by far the hardest and longest part of this
              assignment) were my two main challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
              I feel fairly comfortable filming myself, as well as writing
              scripts, so that didn't take too long, but EDITING the video took
              foreeeeeever. Figuring out how to do transition, add in music,
              creating quick cuts and create different video layouts took a lot
              of effort, but ultimately, I am proud of what I made.
